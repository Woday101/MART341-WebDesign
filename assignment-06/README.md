13. I believe a main head document can have five elements 1. Meta 2.viewport 3. title 4.link 5. style and a body element can have two elements. 1. structural markup 2.semantic markup. Body elements will help guide a user visually and provide information about the type of content through a document. While head elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date.


14. Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document. Structure includes elements such as:
Headings
Paragraphs
Breaks
Lists

Semantic markup us used to reinforce the semantics - or meaning - of the information in a document. Semantic markup might be used to place emphasis on a word or phrase, or identify a word as being strong.

15. My work cycle for this assignment was to review the course webpage and all the elements I would be using for this assignment. My next approach was to choose a simple recipe to start off slow with rather than doing something too crazy out of my experience. Next I double checked to make sure it all worked properly and submitted the assignment for the week!
