              How Often Do Vehicles Need Servicing?
Keeping your Ford vehicle on a regular maintenance schedule is important and one of the easiest ways to ensure its longevity.

Your vehicle is performing under severe driving conditions if you frequently engage in any of the following driving patterns:

You only use your vehicle for short trips of 5 miles or less.
You drive in a harsh climate.
You drive daily in heavy stop-and-go traffic.
Your vehicle is primarily used for towing..

            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
              If your driving usage falls into any of those categories, it’s suggested that you maintain a more vigilant service schedule.

Not only does keeping your vehicle in peak condition prolong its drivability, but you're always improving its trade-in or resale value for when you're ready to purchase or lease your new vehicle.

Did you know that having regular engine maintenance on your vehicle can improve your its gas mileage by 4% AND your fuel efficiency by up to 40% when maintenance detects a critical issue? Just as importantly, regular maintenance helps prevent unexpected failures, worn belts and fluid leaks.

A full list of recommended maintenance checks for your vehicle can be found in your owner’s manual, but here are a few checklist tasks that you can perform yourself once a month in between your routine checkups.

              Make sure all your lights are working properly.
Take a minute to check your tires. If they are balding, or appear to have cuts, bulges or bruises, you should consider making an appointment before your next scheduled visit.
Before starting your vehicle, check your oil for a proper level and to make sure it isn’t sludgy.
Top off your windshield wiper fluid.

            <div class="col-6">
              Make full use of your routine oil change visits. In addition to changing the oil, your Ford Service factory-trained technician can check several fluid levels, confirm your tires are properly inflated, rotate your tires, check your lights, check for undercarriage leaks, inspect your wipers and make sure your air filter is still serviceable.

Ford makes it easy to remember when it’s time for your vehicle’s regularly scheduled maintenance, any major maintenance, and to review your service history — a comprehensive list of service visits (oil changes, tire rotations, etc.). It's all easily accessible by simply signing in to or creating your Ford Owner account. With a Ford Owner account, you can receive maintenance reminders, special offers, and rewards especially for you, to help keep your vehicle running properly.
