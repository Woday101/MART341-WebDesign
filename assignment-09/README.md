Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
 Honestly, being a business major and having zero experience with HTML I found all of this interesting and very enjoyable, I've never liked a class more than this one!

Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
 As mentioned before I have know knowledge so I'm excited about all of it and I hope it is as enjoyable as the HTML section was!

Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes.  What did you do to overcome your challenges?
 Some challenges were looking for the slightest errors that resulted in the entire process not working, it was frustrating at times but worth it in the end. I re examined the entire code over again from the top to look for errors and that usually fixed the problem each time.
