Free Response: Please discuss your successes and challenges.  How did you overcome your challenges?
Some of my successes come from using the todo features on the webpage to practice and better understand how each function works. Next saving and watching my changes happen on a webpage I have found most beneficial to learning and completing each assignment. Some challenges are never using html before or doing any sort of web design work before.
