Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
The universal selector is used to style every element on a page. The universal selector is the star (*). The star is often used in computer science to mean “all.” The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name (the reserved keyword placed in the opening tag of an element). Class names assigned to HTML elements via the class="" attribute can also be used to style elements. To select class elements, prepend a dot (.) to the front of the class name in the CSS.
Using class selectors is a great way to select elements that serve the same function. And lastly Just like the class selector, the ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. ID names are prepended with a number sign (#).


Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes. For this assignment I went with, a Maroon main header and a gold boarder. Next I used a darker gold named goldenrod hex code #DAA520 for my text and a black background to add some contrast. I believe all these colors work well with the theme of the Roaring 20's. When I think if gambling I think about red, gold and black like the inside of many casinos are.


Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them. The challenges this week were coming up with a theme and what colors to use for the theme. When I thought of the Roaring 20's my mind immediately went to gambling and then the colors chose themselves as far as styling went.
