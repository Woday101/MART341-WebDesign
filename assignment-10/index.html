    <strong>Femalegambler</strong> <p style="color:#DAA520">As the United States grew following the Roaring 20's, it became clear that the bigger casinos were leaning towards their male customers, most likely because they were often the ones with much more disposable income up until the 1990s. Then much of Vegas became rebranded to be universally friendly, and thus more gambling games were aimed at women for instance cute slots, a game that offered a more relaxed, friendlier atmosphere.
