What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
System fonts are those already installed on your local device and system. These are available to you and most programs you use, but are not necessarily to the web usually due to licensing. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. They do not have to be available on the user's device to appear, but require certain elements to get called up correctly. Fonts that developers can count on being available by the system are known as "web-safe" fonts.These include font families that both Windows and Mac should have (see the graphic above).
Examples of web safe fonts are:
Arial
Georgia
Times New Roman

What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
The font family property should contain the primary font choice, which is then followed with a comma delimited, list-of-fonts for the browser to try and load should the primary choice fail for some reason. We consider these fallback fonts, in a font stack.

Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them.
My challenges this week were deciding what fonts to use, to make sure it would fit the book style I choose and ensure everyone could read it. I decided to use the same fonts you chose to be on the safe side. I think it turned out nicely which made my decisions a little bit easier!
