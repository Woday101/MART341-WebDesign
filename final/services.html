              WE’VE GOT YOUR BACK
              Things happen. Plans change. We get that. If life throws you a curveball, we won’t throw back a penalty. We will help reschedule trips or travel dates so you can focus on all the good to come, not on feeling let down. Likewise, if you sign up for a specific tour, we will run it. If you’ve felt the sting of a trip being canceled at the last minute due to low enrollment, come to us (as many do) — our doors are always open. We’ve got your back, when you travel with us, you will get what you hoped for (and more!) out of your precious vacation time.

              FAMILY OWNED & OPERATED
              “Family-run” is a term many use lightly, but for us it’s at the core of who we are: a small boutique tour operator, owned and operated by the Austin family out of Billings, Montana. Give us a call or shoot us an email and chances are you’ll hear back from Dan, founder, Carol in customer service, Kasey, president, or Andy, guide and photographer. We’ve remained true to our mission throughout, treating our employees and guests as we do each other — like family. We couldn’t be prouder of who we are and what we do.

              HOMEGROWN GUIDES
              Our guides are an extension of our family. They are the lifeblood of our business, our most important brand ambassadors. Many have worked for us for decades. While others may import, sub-contract, or outsource their guides, we hand-select ours and we aren’t surprised when they are consistently rated as the best in the industry. Even as we stretch our wings internationally, we work closely with our partners to find the best local guides — each of whom is coached extensively in the Austin Adventures way.

              JUST-RIGHT GROUP SIZES
              While many outfitters consider 28-36 (a busload) a small group, we find smaller is so much better. We’ve capped our trips at an average of 12 guests, and our 6:1 guest-to-guide ratio is the lowest in the industry. Our small groups and personalized service allow you to enjoy the beauty, culture, flavor, and excitement of a new land not from the well-trodden tourist track, but from the perspective of an insider.

              UNCANNY ATTENTION TO DETAIL
              Our trips take you off the grid and deep into some of the most beautiful places on the planet. Every detail of your experience with us has been carefully considered. It’s not the behind-the-scenes work that we want you to “ooh” and “ahh” over, however, but just the opposite. We’ve done our job well when all of the fine-tuning (e.g., the equipment, the transfers, the lodging, the meals) melts into your periphery and you’re left with the simple joy of the experience itself, and along with it, the chance to unwind, unplug, and truly connect — with friends, with family, with the local culture, with nature.
