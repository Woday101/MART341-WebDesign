Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)? Everything I learned this semester was all new and exciting to me, using GitHub and setting up repositories was all new and different to me.

Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)? I really enjoyed the media part of the class, I feel it adds more excitement and life to your site, not just text and images.

Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them. Some challenges were just deciding what to do and how to go about setting it up, I decided to take the same approach as the last assignment and piece together the rest from past assignments to make my final project.
